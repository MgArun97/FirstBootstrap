			<h2>International career</h2>
			Early years
			In August 2008, Kohli was included in the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had played only eight List A matches.So, his selection was called a "surprise call-up". During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were injured, Kohli batted as a makeshift opener throughout the series. He made his international debut, at the age of 19, in the first ODI of the tour and was dismissed for 12. He made his first ODI half century, a score of 54, in the fourth match.

			After the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.

			Kohli, after recovering from a minor shoulder injury, returned to the national team replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka. He batted at number 4 for India in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy because of an injury to Yuvraj Singh. He found a place in the home ODI series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 and scored 27 and  in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, Yuvraj's finger injury recurred leading to him being ruled out indefinitely. Kohli returned to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata and scored his first ODI century–107 off 114 balls–sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir. India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1.

			Tendulkar was rested for the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh in January 2010,which enabled Kohli to play in each of India's five matches.During this series He became only the third Indian batsman to score two ODI centuries before their 22nd birthday. Kohli was much praised for his performances during the seriesas the leading run scorer of the series with 275 runs from five innings at an average of 91.66.

			<h3>Test Captaincy</h3>
			For the first Test of the Australian tour in December 2014, Dhoni was not part of the Indian team at Adelaide due to an injury, and Kohli took the reins as Test captain for the first time.[189] Kohli scored 115 in India's first innings, becoming the fourth Indian to score a hundred on Test captaincy debut.[190] In their second innings, India were set a target of 364 to be scored on the fifth day. Kohli put on 185 runs for the third wicket with Murali Vijay before Vijay's dismissal, which triggered a batting collapse. From 242/2, India was bowled out for 315 with Kohli's 141 off 175 balls being the top score.[191]

			Dhoni returned to the team as captain for the second match at Brisbane where Kohli scored 19 and 1 in a four-wicket defeat for India.[82] In the Melbourne Boxing Day Test, he made his personal best Test score of 169 in the first innings while sharing a 262-run partnership with Rahane, India's biggest partnership outside Asia in ten years.[192] Kohli followed it with a score of 54 in India's second innings on the fifth day, helping his team draw the Test match.[82] Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket at the conclusion of this match, and Kohli was appointed as the full-time Test captain ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney.[193][194] Captaining the Test team for the second time, Kohli hit 147 in the first innings of the match and became the first batsman in Test cricket history to score three hundreds in his first three innings as Test captain.[195] He was dismissed for 46 in the second innings and the match ended in a draw.[196] Kohli's total of 692 runs in four Tests was the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia.[195]

In January 2015, India failed to win a single match in the tri-nation ODI series against the hosts Australia and England. Kohli was unable to replicate his Test success in ODIs, failing to make a two-digit score in any of the four games.[46] Kohli's ODI form did not improve in the lead-up to the World Cup, with scores of 18 and 5 in the warm-up matches against Australia and Afghanistan respectively.

In the first match of the World Cup against Pakistan at Adelaide, Kohli hit 107 in 126 balls. For his knock, he was awarded the man of the match award.[197] Kohli also became first Indian batsman to score a century against Pakistan in a World Cup match.[198] He was dismissed for 46 in India's second match against South Africa. India went on to register a 130-run victory in the match. India batted second in their remaining four group matches in which Kohli scored 33*, 33, 44* and 38 against UAE, West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe respectively.[46] India went on to secure wins in these four fixtures and top the Pool B points with an undefeated record.[199] In India's 109-run victory in the quarter-final over Bangladesh, Kohli was dismissed by Rubel Hossain for 3, edging the ball to the wicket-keeper. India was eliminated in the semi-final by Australia at Melbourne, where Kohli was dismissed for 1 off 13 balls, top-edging a short-pitched delivery from Mitchell Johnson.[46]

Kohli had a slump in form when India toured Bangladesh in June 2015. He contributed only 14 in the one-off Test which ended in a draw and averaged 16.33 in the ODI series which Bangladesh won 2–1.[200] Kohli ended his streak of low scores by scoring his 11th Test hundred in the first Test of the Sri Lankan tour which India lost. India won the next two matches to seal the series 2–1, Kohli's first series win as Test captain and India's first away Test series win in four years.[201]

During South Africa's tour of India, Kohli became the fastest batsman in the world to make 1,000 runs in T20I cricket, reaching the milestone in his 27th innings.[202] In the ODI series, he made a century in the fourth ODI at Chennai that helped India draw level in the series.[203] India lost the series after a defeat in the final ODI and Kohli finished the series with an average of 49.[204] India came back to beat the top-ranked South African team 3–0 in the four-match Test series under Kohli's captaincy, and climbed to number two position on the ICC Test rankings.[205] Virat scored a total of 200 runs in the series at 33.33.[82]

		<h3>Performance in Limited Overs</h3>

		When India toured the West Indies in June–July 2011, they selected a largely inexperienced squad, resting Tendulkar and others such as- Gambhir and Sehwag missing out due to injuries. Kohli was one of three uncapped players in the Test squad.[79] He found success in the ODI series which India won 3–2, with a total of 199 runs at an average of 39.80.[80] His best efforts came in the second ODI at Port of Spain where he won the man of the match for his score of 81 which gave India a seven-wicket victory,[81] and the fifth ODI at Kingston where his innings of 94 came in a seven-wicket defeat.[46] Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed. He batted at 5 and was dismissed for 4 and 15 caught behind off the bowling of Fidel Edwards in both innings.[82] India went on to win the Test series 1–0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings,[83] struggling against the short ball[84] and was particularly troubled by the fast bowling of Edwards, who dismissed him three times in the series.[85]

		Initially dropped from the Test squad for India's four-match series in England in July and August due to poor performance in his debut series, Kohli was recalled as a replacement for the injured Yuvraj,[86] though he did not got to play in any match in the series. He found moderate success in the subsequent ODI series in which he averaged 38.80.[87] His score of 55 in the first ODI at Chester-le-Street was followed by a string of low scores in the next three matches.[46] In the last game of the series, Kohli scored his sixth ODI hundred–107 runs off 93 balls–and shared a 170-run third-wicket partnership with Rahul Dravid,[88] who was playing his last ODI, to help India post their first 300-plus total of the tour.[89] Kohli was dismissed hit wicket in that innings which was the only century in the series by any player on either team and earned him praise for his "hard work" and "maturity".[90] However, England won the match by D/L method and the series 3–0.[citation needed]

		In October 2011, Kohli was the leading run-scorer of the five-match home ODI series against England which India won 5–0. He scored a total of 270 runs across five matches at an average of 90, including unbeaten knocks of 112 from 98 balls at Delhi, where he put on an unbroken 209-run partnership with Gambhir,[91] and 86 at Mumbai, both in successful run-chases.[46][92] Owing to his ODI success, Kohli was included in the Test squad to face the West Indies in November. He was selected in the final match of the series in which he scored a pair of fifties in the match.[93] India won the subsequent ODI series 4–1 in which Kohli managed to accumulate 243 runs at 60.75.[94] During the series, Kohli scored his eighth ODI century and his second at Visakhapatnam, where he made 117 off 123 balls in India's run-chase of 270,[95] a knock which raised his reputation as "an expert of the chase".[96] Kohli ended up as the leading run-getter in ODIs for the year 2011, with 1381 runs from 34 matches at 47.62 including four centuries and eight fifties.[97]

		During tour of Australia in December 2011, Kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two Tests, as his defensive technique was exposed.[98] While fielding on the boundary during the second day of the second match, he gestured to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the match referee.[99] He top-scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth, with 44 and 75, even as India got their second consecutive innings defeat.[100][101] In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century of 116 runs in the first innings.[102] India suffered a 0–4 whitewash and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series, was described as "the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists".
